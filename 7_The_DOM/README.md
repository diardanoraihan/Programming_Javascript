# Document Object Model (DOM)

The intended purpose of Javascript is to manipulate webpages, hence we use DOM for that. Without the DOM, we cannot interact with tags in HTML. __Think of this as an API that we can use__.

## Definition:
"The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods." - _Mozilla Developer Network_

## Description:
* Programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
* Provides a structured representation of the document.
* Defines methods to access the structure and manipulate it.
* Connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.
* DOM is NOT programming language, it provides a model of a web page.
* The page content is stored in the DOM and can be accessed and manipulated in Javascript.
