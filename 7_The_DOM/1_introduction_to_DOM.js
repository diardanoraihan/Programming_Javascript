/*
* Document Object Model (DOM)
* ---------------------------
* The intended purpose of Javascript is to manipulate webpages, hence we use DOM for that.
* Without the DOM, we cannot interact with tags in HTML. 
* 
* Definition:
* "The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes 
* and objects that have properties and methods."
* 
* Description:
* - Programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
* - Provides a structured representation of the document.
* - Defines methods to access the structure and manipulate it.
* - Connects web pages to scripts or programming languages.
* - DOM is NOT programming language, it provides a model of a web page.
* - The page content is stored in the DOM and can be accessed and manipulated in Javascript.
